Whenever we have to create Object, we use Factory Pattern.
Based on some condition.

if cond1, obj1
if cond2, obj2

If on conditional basis, we have to create objects, we use Factory pattern, 

Suppose we have many class, having oject created based on different parameter in each class.

Shape interface{

    method draw()

}

Circle -> is a -> Shape
Rectangle is a Shape
Square is a Shape

There is a shape factory which has a -> shape that creates required object based on usinees logic.

When we have to create same object in many places, based on some condition, then there will be  a
duplicacy. There we use Factory Pattern.
