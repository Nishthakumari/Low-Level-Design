// Above code is already tested and live, its not good to modify it to add save to File fucntion.
// It is prone to bugs.

    }
}


//To solve this, Take an interface of Invoice Dao, and implements it for file , DB, or SQL or 
//MongoDb type of saivng. This means if any new type of databse comes, we can just create a new class implementing InvoiceDao,
//no need to change already implemented classes.


package com.example.lld;

interface InvoiceDao{
    public void save(Invoice invoice);
}
class DatabaseInvoiceDao implements InvoiceDao{

    public void save(Invoice invoice) {
        //save to DB
    }
}

class FileInvoiceDao implements InvoiceDao{

    public void save(Invoice invoice) {
        //save to file
    }
