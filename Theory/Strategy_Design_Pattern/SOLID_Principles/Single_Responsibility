// Invoice class is getting changes due to many reasons.

// Now if we try to change our calculation Logic, This class will change.

// Or if our save to DB logic changes, it changes.

// Thus, This class is having many responsibilty instead of just one.

// InvoiceDao is used to save invoice invoice into DB.
// invoicePrinter is used to print invoice.

// Thus, all classes have single responsibility now.
